As alway amazed by your design and focused funcionality. This is great! 
You can find the specific niche for your web application.

All codes are categorized into proper files. 
More importantly your codes are very friendly for layman and enjoys high readbility.

Some suggestions:

1. It would be better if you could include more comments in your major components such as WishBoard.jsx, MyWishes.jsx and GiftList.jsx.
2. You may add .DS_Store into your .gitignore.
3. Links in the README.md file hook to your last project and need to be updated. So do the screenshots.
4. There should be a description above the webpage and this version of codes should also be realeased.

Besides these minors, your work is awesome. Hope we can have the chance to let you guys share how you come up with ideas like this 
and how you design. Well done!
